Kit is a JavaScript SDK for building Solana apps across environments like Node, the web, and React Native. It provides a comprehensive set of data types and helper functions, forming the foundation for interacting with Solana in JavaScript.

## Quick start

Follow these simple steps to install and get started with Kit:

<Steps>
<Step>
 
### Install Kit

Install Kit using the main `@solana/kit` library. It includes many smaller packages — such as `@solana/rpc` or `@solana/transactions` — that can also be used individually for more granular imports.

```package-install
@solana/kit
```

</Step>

<Step>

### Install program clients

Install Kit compatible clients for any program you want to interact with. For example, to interact with the System program, install the `@solana-program/system` package. You can find a [list of available program clients here](/docs/compatible-clients).

```package-install
npm install @solana-program/system \
  @solana-program/memo \
  @solana-program/token \
  @solana-program/compute-budget
```

</Step>

<Step>

### Set up your project

Use primitives provided by Kit to set up your project and start interacting with Solana!

For example, if you are planning on sending transactions, you will likely need an RPC API, an RPC Subscriptions API and a "send and confirm" strategy.

```ts twoslash
import {
    createSolanaRpc,
    createSolanaRpcSubscriptions,
    sendAndConfirmTransactionFactory,
} from '@solana/kit';

const rpc = createSolanaRpc('https://api.devnet.solana.com');
const rpcSubscriptions = createSolanaRpcSubscriptions('wss://api.devnet.solana.com');
const sendAndConfirmTransaction = sendAndConfirmTransactionFactory({ rpc, rpcSubscriptions });
```
