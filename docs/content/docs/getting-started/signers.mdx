description: Create a new keypair signer and airdrop lamports to it
---

Before we can start crafting transactions, we're going to need a wallet that can sign transactions and pay for fees. In this article, we'll explore how to generate new keypairs and how to airdrop some lamports to them in test environments.

## Generate a new `CryptoKeypair`

The Solana Kit library uses the [native Crypto API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Crypto) for cryptographic tasks like generating key pairs and signing or verifying messages. This improves security by leveraging the browser's built-in functions instead of third-party libraries.

To create a new keypair, you can use the `generateKeyPair` helper function. This will return an instance of the native `CryptoKeyPair` type.

```ts twoslash
import { generateKeyPair } from "@solana/kit";

const wallet: CryptoKeyPair = await generateKeyPair();
```

And just like that, we have a wallet that can be used to sign transactions. However, Solana Kit provides a useful abstraction on top of anything that can sign messages and/or transactions called `Signers`.

## Generate a new `KeyPairSigner`

Using `CryptoKeyPairs` is one way to sign and verify transactions but it isn't the only way. What if I want my transactions to be signed by an in-browser wallet? What if I want to sign them using a hardware wallet instead? What about a multisig wallet? Or what if I want some custom logic that detects the best way to sign a transaction based on the current environment?

The `Signer` API allows us to decouple the signing logic from the rest of our code by providing signer interfaces that can be leveraged throughout the library. A `Signer` is an object that holds an `Address` and implements its own signing logic for messages and transactions.

Different types of signers are available for various use cases, but in this tutorial, we'll focus on the `KeyPairSigner` which signs transactions and messages using a `CryptoKeyPair`. It implements the `TransactionSigner` and `MessageSigner` interfaces so any function that requires a transaction or message signer will be able to use it.

We can use the `generateKeyPairSigner` function to create a new `KeyPairSigner` instance like so.

```ts twoslash
import { generateKeyPairSigner } from "@solana/kit";

const wallet = await generateKeyPairSigner();
```

As you can see, this is very similar to generating a `CryptoKeyPair`, but now we have an abstracted `Signer` object that can be replaced with any other type of signer in the future without affecting the rest of our code.

For instance, here's how we could replace our `KeyPairSigner` with a signer that uses an in-browser wallet instead.

```ts twoslash
import { generateKeyPairSigner, KeyPairSigner, TransactionSigner } from "@solana/kit";
import { useWalletAccountTransactionSendingSigner } from "@solana/react";
// ---cut-start---
const account = null as unknown as Parameters<typeof useWalletAccountTransactionSendingSigner>[0];
const currentChain = null as unknown as Parameters<typeof useWalletAccountTransactionSendingSigner>[1];
// ---cut-end---

let wallet: TransactionSigner;
wallet = await generateKeyPairSigner(); // [!code --]
wallet = useWalletAccountTransactionSendingSigner(account, currentChain); // [!code ++]
```

## Airdrop lamports

Now that we know how to generate a new signer, let's make sure we give it some lamports so it can pay for transaction fees and account storage. For that we can use the `airdropFactory` function. Given an RPC and RPC subscriptions object, it will return a function that can be used to airdrop lamports to any address â€” provided we are in a test environment such as localnet.

```ts twoslash
import {
  airdropFactory,
  createSolanaRpc,
  createSolanaRpcSubscriptions,
  generateKeyPairSigner,
  lamports,
} from "@solana/kit";

// Create the RPC, RPC Subscriptions and airdrop function.
const rpc = createSolanaRpc("http://127.0.0.1:8899");
const rpcSubscriptions = createSolanaRpcSubscriptions("ws://127.0.0.1:8900");
const airdrop = airdropFactory({ rpc, rpcSubscriptions });

// Generate a new wallet with 1 SOL.
const wallet = await generateKeyPairSigner();
await airdrop({
  recipientAddress: wallet.address,
  lamports: lamports(1_000_000_000n),
  commitment: "confirmed",
});
```

## Adjust our `Client` object

Since we're going to rely on this signer for the rest of the tutorial, let's adjust our `Client` object to include it.

```ts twoslash title="src/client.ts"
import {
  createSolanaRpc,
  createSolanaRpcSubscriptions,
  Rpc,
  RpcSubscriptions,
  SolanaRpcApi,
  SolanaRpcSubscriptionsApi,
} from "@solana/kit";
// ---cut-before---
import { airdropFactory, generateKeyPairSigner, lamports, MessageSigner, TransactionSigner } from "@solana/kit";

export type Client = {
  rpc: Rpc<SolanaRpcApi>;
  rpcSubscriptions: RpcSubscriptions<SolanaRpcSubscriptionsApi>;
  wallet: TransactionSigner & MessageSigner;
};

let client: Client | undefined;
export async function createClient(): Promise<Client> {
  if (!client) {
    // Create RPC objects and airdrop function.
    const rpc = createSolanaRpc("http://127.0.0.1:8899");
    const rpcSubscriptions = createSolanaRpcSubscriptions("ws://127.0.0.1:8900");
    const airdrop = airdropFactory({ rpc, rpcSubscriptions });

    // Create a wallet with lamports.
    const wallet = await generateKeyPairSigner();
    await airdrop({
      recipientAddress: wallet.address,
      lamports: lamports(1_000_000_000n),
      commitment: "confirmed",
    });

    // Store the client.
    client = { rpc, rpcSubscriptions, wallet };
  }
  return client;
}
```

Notice how we had to make the `createClient` function asynchronous since it now contains asynchronous code to generate the `KeyPairSigner` and airdrop lamports to it. That means, we also need to adjust our main `tutorial` function accordingly. And whilst we're at it, let's display the balance of our newly created wallet.

```ts twoslash title="src/index.ts"
import {
  Rpc,
  RpcSubscriptions,
  SolanaRpcApi,
  SolanaRpcSubscriptionsApi,
  TransactionSigner,
  MessageSigner,
} from "@solana/kit";
export type Client = {
  rpc: Rpc<SolanaRpcApi>;
  rpcSubscriptions: RpcSubscriptions<SolanaRpcSubscriptionsApi>;
  wallet: TransactionSigner & MessageSigner;
};
export async function createClient() {
  return {} as Client;
}
// ---cut-before---
async function tutorial() {
  const client = await createClient();
  const { value: balance } = await client.rpc.getBalance(client.wallet.address).send();
  console.log(`Balance: ${balance} lamports.`);
}
```

We've now got everything we need to start crafting transactions! In the next article, we'll build instructions that create a new token on Solana.
