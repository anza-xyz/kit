title: Fetch an account
description: Fetch and decode on-chain accounts
---

In the previous article of this series, we've learned how to send a transaction that creates a new Solana token — also known as a `Mint` account. In this last article, we'll learn how to retrieve the account we created and access its decoded data.

## Fetch using RPC methods

RPC methods such as `getAccountInfo` or `getMultipleAccounts` can be used to fetch on-chain accounts from their addresses. These take a variety of options and return different outputs based on these options. For instance, the `encoding` option will determine which string format to use when returning the account's encoded data.

```ts twoslash
import { Rpc, SolanaRpcApi } from '@solana/kit';
const rpc = null as unknown as Rpc<SolanaRpcApi>;
// ---cut-before---
import { address } from '@solana/kit';

const { value: account } = await rpc.getAccountInfo(address('1234..5678')).send();
const { value: accounts } = await rpc.getMultipleAccounts([address('1234..5678')]).send();
```

## Fetch using helpers

Having so many possible return values makes it harder to work with the retrieved information. For instance, the `getAccountInfo` RPC method will default to a Base58 encoding whereas the `getMultipleAccounts` method will default to Base64.

Additionally, when trying to fetch an account that does not exist on-chain, the `null` value is returned which is particularly inconvenient when dealing with multiple accounts as it requires zipping the address array with the account array to determine which ones are missing.

Therefore, Kit offers a set of types and helpers that aim to unify these APIs and make them easier to work with. For instance, the `fetchEncodedAccount` and `fetchEncodedAccounts` helpers can be used to fetch one or multiple accounts and return them in a unified format.

```ts twoslash
import { Rpc, SolanaRpcApi } from '@solana/kit';
const rpc = null as unknown as Rpc<SolanaRpcApi>;
// ---cut-before---
import {
    address,
    fetchEncodedAccount,
    fetchEncodedAccounts,
    MaybeEncodedAccount,
} from '@solana/kit';

const account = await fetchEncodedAccount(rpc, address('1234..5678'));
const accounts = await fetchEncodedAccounts(rpc, [address('1234..5678')]);

account satisfies MaybeEncodedAccount;
accounts satisfies MaybeEncodedAccount[];
```

As you can see, the return types are all `MaybeAccounts`. This means the account may or may not exist on-chain. It contains an `exists` field indicating whether the account exists. If it does, we have access to all its fields. Otherwise, we just know its address — since it was provided as an input.

```ts twoslash
import { Rpc, SolanaRpcApi } from '@solana/kit';
const rpc = null as unknown as Rpc<SolanaRpcApi>;
// ---cut-before---
import {
    EncodedAccount,
    address,
    Address,
    fetchEncodedAccount,
    fetchEncodedAccounts,
} from '@solana/kit';

const account = await fetchEncodedAccount(rpc, address('1234..5678'));

if (account.exists) {
    // If it exists, we have access to all its fields.
    account satisfies EncodedAccount<'1234..5678'>;
} else {
    // Otherwise, we just know its address.
    account satisfies { address: Address<'1234..5678'>; exists: false };
}
```

We can also assert the existence of an account using the `assertAccountExists` helper. This will throw an error if the account does not exist and tell TypeScript that our `MaybeAccount` is actually an `Account` moving forward.

```ts twoslash
import { Rpc, SolanaRpcApi } from '@solana/kit';
const rpc = null as unknown as Rpc<SolanaRpcApi>;
// ---cut-before---
import {
    assertAccountExists,
    EncodedAccount,
    address,
    fetchEncodedAccount,
    fetchEncodedAccounts,
} from '@solana/kit';

const account = await fetchEncodedAccount(rpc, address('1234..5678'));
assertAccountExists(account);

account satisfies EncodedAccount;
```

## Decode the data manually

So far, we have been dealing with encoded accounts, meaning the `data` field of the fetched account is a byte array — i.e. a `Uint8Array`. But we are realistically going to need to decode that data into a more usable format.

Kit ships with a set of serialization libraries called Codecs. These libraries offer types and functions to create Codec objects that can be composed together to create more complex serialization and deserialization logic.

You can [read more about Codecs here](/docs/concepts/codecs), but let's quickly see how we can create a Codec object to decode our `Mint` account.

Mint accounts are composed of the following data:

- A `mintAuthority` which is an optional address. When set, this address can mint new tokens.
- A `supply` integer using a `u64`. This keeps track of the total supply of tokens.
- A `decimals` integer using a `u8`. This keeps track of the number of decimal places for the token.
- An `isInitialized` boolean using a single byte. This tells us whether the mint account has been initialized.
- A `freezeAuthority` which is an optional address. When set, this address can freeze token accounts.

By composing various Codec functions — such as `getStructCodec` to create objects or `getOptionCodec` to create optional data — we can design a Codec object that describes the byte layout of the `Mint` account. Here's an example illustrating that. Note that the layout of the `Mint` account was slightly simplified for this example.

```ts twoslash
import { Rpc, SolanaRpcApi } from '@solana/kit';
const rpc = null as unknown as Rpc<SolanaRpcApi>;
// ---cut-before---
import {
    address,
    Address,
    assertAccountExists,
    fetchEncodedAccount,
    getAddressCodec,
    getBooleanCodec,
    getOptionCodec,
    getStructCodec,
    getU64Codec,
    getU8Codec,
    Option,
} from '@solana/kit';

const account = await fetchEncodedAccount(rpc, address('1234..5678'));
assertAccountExists(account);

const mintCodec = getStructCodec([
    ['mintAuthority', getOptionCodec(getAddressCodec())], // [simplified]
    ['supply', getU64Codec()],
    ['decimals', getU8Codec()],
    ['isInitialized', getBooleanCodec()],
    ['freezeAuthority', getOptionCodec(getAddressCodec())], // [simplified]
]);

const decodedData = mintCodec.decode(account.data);
decodedData satisfies {
    mintAuthority: Option<Address>;
    supply: bigint;
    decimals: number;
    isInitialized: boolean;
    freezeAuthority: Option<Address>;
};
```

## Decode using program clients

Fortunately for us, we often don't need to manually create these Codec objects as program clients will provide them for us. These helpers are typically [generated via Codama IDLs](https://github.com/codama-idl/codama) and follow the `getXCodec` naming convention where `X` is the name of the account.

For instance, here's how we can access the `Mint` codec from the `@solana-program/token` library.

```ts twoslash
import { Rpc, SolanaRpcApi } from '@solana/kit';
const rpc = null as unknown as Rpc<SolanaRpcApi>;
// ---cut-before---
import { address, assertAccountExists, fetchEncodedAccount } from '@solana/kit';
import { getMintCodec, Mint } from '@solana-program/token';

const account = await fetchEncodedAccount(rpc, address('1234..5678'));
assertAccountExists(account);

const mintCodec = getMintCodec();
const decodedData = mintCodec.decode(account.data);
decodedData satisfies Mint;
```

This can be simplified even further by using the `decodeX` helpers from program clients. These helpers accept an `EncodedAccount` or a `MaybeEncodedAccount` and return an `Account<T>` or a `MaybeAccount<T>` respectively, where `T` is the type of the account data.

```ts twoslash
import { Rpc, SolanaRpcApi } from '@solana/kit';
const rpc = null as unknown as Rpc<SolanaRpcApi>;
// ---cut-before---
import { Account, address, assertAccountExists, fetchEncodedAccount } from '@solana/kit';
import { decodeMint, Mint } from '@solana-program/token';

const account = decodeMint(await fetchEncodedAccount(rpc, address('1234..5678')));
assertAccountExists(account);
account satisfies Account<Mint>;
```

## Fetch and decode using program clients

Last but not least, it is possible to fetch and decode an account in a single step using the `fetchX` helpers from program clients. These helpers accept an `Rpc` object and an `Address` and return an `Account<T>` where `T` is the type of the account data. These helpers will also assert the existence of the account and throw an error if it does not exist.

This means, everything we've been doing so far can be simplified into a single line of code.

```ts twoslash
import { Rpc, SolanaRpcApi } from '@solana/kit';
const rpc = null as unknown as Rpc<SolanaRpcApi>;
// ---cut-before---
import { Account, address } from '@solana/kit';
import { fetchMint, Mint } from '@solana-program/token';

const account = await fetchMint(rpc, address('1234..5678'));
account satisfies Account<Mint>;
```

## Update `index.ts`

Now that we know how to fetch and decode on-chain accounts, let's update our main `tutorial` function to fetch the `Mint` account we created in the previous article and display its decoded data.

Since some of its data is optional, we'll use the `unwrapOption` helper to convert `Option<T>` types into `T | null` before displaying them.

```ts twoslash title="src/index.ts"
// @filename: client.ts
import {
    BaseTransactionMessage,
    TransactionMessageWithFeePayer,
    MessageSigner,
    Rpc,
    RpcSubscriptions,
    SolanaRpcApi,
    SolanaRpcSubscriptionsApi,
    TransactionSigner,
    sendAndConfirmTransactionFactory,
} from '@solana/kit';
export type Client = {
    estimateAndSetComputeUnitLimit: <
        T extends BaseTransactionMessage & TransactionMessageWithFeePayer,
    >(
        transactionMessage: T,
    ) => Promise<T>;
    rpc: Rpc<SolanaRpcApi>;
    rpcSubscriptions: RpcSubscriptions<SolanaRpcSubscriptionsApi>;
    sendAndConfirmTransaction: ReturnType<typeof sendAndConfirmTransactionFactory>;
    wallet: TransactionSigner & MessageSigner;
};
export async function createClient() {
    return {} as Client;
}
// @filename: create-mint.ts
import { Address } from '@solana/kit';
import { Client } from './client';
export async function createMint(client: Client, options: { decimals?: number } = {}) {
    return '' as Address;
}
// @filename: index.ts
// ---cut-before---
import { unwrapOption } from '@solana/kit'; // [!code ++]
import { fetchMint } from '@solana-program/token'; // [!code ++]

import { createClient } from './client';
import { createMint } from './create-mint';

async function tutorial() {
    const client = await createClient();
    const mintAddress = await createMint(client, { decimals: 2 });
    const mintAccount = await fetchMint(client.rpc, mintAddress); // [!code ++]
    console.log(`Mint created: ${mintAddress}.`);
    // [!code ++:4]
    console.log(`Mint lamports: ${mintAccount.lamports}.`);
    console.log(`Mint authority: ${unwrapOption(mintAccount.data.mintAuthority)}.`);
    console.log(`Mint decimals: ${mintAccount.data.decimals}.`);
    console.log(`Mint supply: ${mintAccount.data.supply}.`);
}
```

You should now see the following output when you run the `start` script:

```
Mint created: 4txHAwAuUDJAdzuNnfaL88kj4hF7wa3U3kak91r4keju.
Mint lamports: 1461600.
Mint authority: 9QR4w82jYj2eSVdzLprHZwrgEReFCGQNRPrBN2v8BCBG.
Mint decimals: 2.
Mint supply: 0.
```

## Next steps

Congrats on completing this tutorial! You've learned how to get started with the Kit library by:

- Creating a `Client` object containing all the bits from Kit that matter for your application — ensuring the rest can be tree-shaken away.
- Building instructions and transaction messages.
- Generating signer objects and using them to sign transactions.
- Sending transactions and waiting for them to be confirmed.
- Fetching and decoding on-chain accounts that were created by your transactions.

If you'd like to dig deeper into the Kit library, you may be interested in the [Core concepts](/docs/concepts) section of the documentation. There, you'll find in-depth articles about specific parts of the library such as [Codecs](/docs/concepts/codecs), [Signers](/docs/concepts/signers), and [RPCs](/docs/concepts/rpc).
