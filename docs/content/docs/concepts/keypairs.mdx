description: Sign and verify messages and transactions using Ed25519 keys
---

## Introduction

Kit uses the primitives built-in to JavaScriptâ€™s Web Crypto API to perform cryptography. This keeps your applications small, and confers to them the security and performance characteristics of the runtime's native cryptography functions.

Ed25519 keys created or imported using the native APIs are compatible with all of Kit's cryptographic features. Kit also offers several helpers to generate, import, and transform key material.

<Callout title="Looking for Signers instead?">
    Keys are a low-level primitive. While it's important to know how they work, in a Solana
    application it's often more appropriate to deal with key material in terms of the accounts and
    wallets that sign a transaction or message. The [Signers](/concepts/signers) API offers an
    ergonomic way to build and sign transactions using accounts and their associated keys.

## Installation

Key management functions are **included within the `@solana/kit` library** but you may also install them using their standalone package.

```package-install
@solana/keys
```

<Callout title="Not all runtimes support the cryptography required by Solana" type="warn">
    When deploying your application to a JavaScript runtime that lacks support for the Ed25519
    digital signature algorithm, [import our polyfill](#polyfill) before invoking any operations
    that create or make use of `CryptoKey` objects.
</Callout>

## What is a key pair?

A key pair is a data type composed of 256-bits of random data (the private key) and a Cartesian point (the public key) on the curve that is used to cryptographically sign and verify Solana transactions. The interface definition of `CryptoKeyPair` is:

```ts
interface CryptoKeyPair {
    privateKey: CryptoKey;
    publicKey: CryptoKey;
}
```

Together, these keys represent an address on Solana and its owner. The 256-bit address is derived from the coordinates of the public key itself.

## What is a key?

A key is an object native to the JavaScript runtime that supports the [`CryptoKey`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/CryptoKey) interface. You can use a `CryptoKey` with the native [`SubtleCrypto` API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/SubtleCrypto) to sign messages and to verify signatures. Kit builds on these capabilities to enable the use of `CryptoKey` objects to sign and verify Solana transactions and off-chain messages.

## Managing keys

### Generating new keys

You can use the native [`SubtleCrypto#generateKey`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/SubtleCrypto/generateKey) API, or the [`generateKeyPair()`](/api/functions/generateKeyPair) helper to create a new random key pair.

<Tabs items={["SubtleCrypto API", "Kit"]}>
  <Tab value="SubtleCrypto API">
      ```ts twoslash
      const keyPair = await crypto.subtle.generateKey(
        /* algorithm */ { name: 'Ed25519' },
        /* extractable */ false,
        /* usages */ ['sign', 'verify'],
      );
      ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab value="Kit">
    ```ts twoslash
    import { generateKeyPair } from '@solana/kit';
    const keyPair = await generateKeyPair();
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

This is useful in cases where you need to sign for the creation of a new account with a random address, using an ephemeral key pair that can be discarded after the account is created and assigned to a program.

### Importing a key

You can create a `CryptoKeyPair` using the 64 bytes of a pre-generated key. This is possible to do with the native [`SubtleCrypto#importKey`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/SubtleCrypto/importKey) API, but it is more convenient to use the helpers in Kit.

```ts twoslash
import { createKeyPairFromBytes } from '@solana/kit';
const keyPair = await createKeyPairFromBytes(
    new Uint8Array([
        /* 32 bytes representing the private key */
        /* 32 bytes representing the public key */
    ]),
);
```

In cases where you have only the 32 bytes representing the private key but not its associated public key, you can use a different function that will automatically derive the public key from the private key.

```ts twoslash
import { createKeyPairFromPrivateKeyBytes } from '@solana/kit';
const keyPair = await createKeyPairFromPrivateKeyBytes(
    new Uint8Array([
        /* 32 bytes representing the private key */
    ]),
);
```

### Storing keys

`CryptoKey` objects can be stored locally by runtimes that support the [IndexedDB API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/IndexedDB_API).

Given an instance of an `IDBDatabase` with an object store called `'MyKeyPairStore'`:

```ts twoslash
const db = await new Promise<IDBDatabase>((resolve, reject) => {
    const request = indexedDB.open('MyDatabase', 1);
    request.onupgradeneeded = (e) => {
        const db = (e.target as IDBOpenDBRequest).result;
        db.createObjectStore('MyKeyPairStore');
    };
    request.onsuccess = (e) => {
        resolve((e.target as IDBOpenDBRequest).result);
    };
    request.onerror = (e) => {
        reject((e.target as IDBOpenDBRequest).error);
    };
});
```

You can store a key pair like this:

```ts twoslash
const db = null as unknown as IDBDatabase;
const keyPair = null as unknown as CryptoKeyPair;
// ---cut-before---
const transaction = db.transaction('MyKeyPairStore', 'readwrite');
const store = transaction.objectStore('MyKeyPairStore');
await new Promise<void>((resolve, reject) => {
    const request = store.put(keyPair, 'myStoredKey');
    request.onsuccess = () => resolve();
    request.onerror = () => reject(request.error);
});
```

And then later retrieve it like this:

```ts twoslash
const db = null as unknown as IDBDatabase;
// ---cut-before---
const transaction = db.transaction('MyKeyPairStore', 'readonly');
const store = transaction.objectStore('MyKeyPairStore');
const loadedKeyPair = await new Promise<CryptoKeyPair>((resolve, reject) => {
    const request = store.get('myStoredKey');
    request.onsuccess = () => {
        if (request.result) {
            resolve(request.result);
        } else {
            reject(new Error('Key not found'));
        }
    };
    request.onerror = () => reject(request.error);
});
```

<Callout type="warn">
    Keys stored in IndexedDB are local to the host, are subject to its [storage limits and eviction
    criteria](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/IndexedDB_API#storage_limits_and_eviction_criteria),
    and can not be accessed from a domain other than the one that stored them when the host is a web
    browser. Keys that are evicted from storage or erased by the user can generally not be
    recovered.
</Callout>

### Exporting a key

You can obtain the 32 bytes of any public key like this:

```ts twoslash
const keyPair = null as unknown as CryptoKeyPair;
// ---cut-before---
const publicKeyBytes = new Uint8Array(await crypto.subtle.exportKey('raw', keyPair.publicKey));
```

Exporting private key material requires a specially constructed `CryptoKey` with its extractable property set to `true`.

```ts twoslash
const keyPair = await crypto.subtle.generateKey(
    /* algorithm */ { name: 'Ed25519' },
    /* extractable */ true,
    //                ^^^^
    /* usages */ ['sign', 'verify'],
);
```

You can then use that `CryptoKey` with the [`SubtleCrypto#exportKey`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/SubtleCrypto/exportKey) API. The last 32 bytes of a PKCS#8 export of the key are the private key bytes.

```ts twoslash
const keyPair = null as unknown as CryptoKeyPair;
// ---cut-before---
const exportedPrivateKey = await crypto.subtle.exportKey('pkcs8', keyPair.privateKey);
const privateKeyBytes = new Uint8Array(exportedPrivateKey, exportedPrivateKey.byteLength - 32, 32);
```

<Callout title="Security warning" type="warn">
    Exporting private key material in JavaScript is not recommended, and you should take extreme
    care when doing so. Private key bytes exported through these APIs are vulnerable to theft (eg.
    by code running in your JavaScript sandbox) and accidental logging (eg. to the console or to a
    third-party logger).
</Callout>

## Using private keys

A private key is a `CryptoKey` whose `type` property is set to `'private'` and whose `usages` property includes `'sign'`.

Private keys can be used by their owner to produce a digital signature of a specific message. You can think of a signature as representing the key owner's approval of, agreement to, or endorsement of the message. Private key owners must never share the key with anyone.

### Signing messages

Any data that you can serialize as a `Uint8Array` can be signed with a `CryptoKey`.

```ts twoslash
import { ReadonlyUint8Array } from '@solana/kit';
// ---cut-before---
import { getU32Encoder, getUtf8Encoder } from '@solana/kit';
const messageFromText = getUtf8Encoder().encode('ðŸŽ‰');
const messageFromU32 = getU32Encoder().encode(0xdeadbeef);
const messageOfBytes = new Uint8Array([1, 2, 3]);
```

Supply a message and a private key to the [`signBytes()`](/api/functions/signBytes) function to obtain a 64-byte digital signature.

```ts twoslash
const bobsKeyPair = null as unknown as CryptoKeyPair;
// ---cut-before---
import { getUtf8Encoder, signBytes } from '@solana/kit';
const message = getUtf8Encoder().encode('The meeting is at 6:00pm');
const bobsSignature = await signBytes(bobsKeyPair.privateKey, message);
console.log(bobsSignature);
// @log: Uint8Array(64) [79, 43, 140, 65, 177, 35, 169, 61, 62, 228, 190, 202, 205, 143, 4, 35, 83, 228, 47, 76, 68, 62, 125, 140, 21, 102, 182, 105, 24, 238, 67, 40, 179, 255, 247, 136, 95, 119, 46, 244, 44, 224, 100, 111, 68, 110, 189, 224, 159, 144, 197, 181, 210, 132, 101, 226, 120, 200, 0, 102, 104, 65, 216, 3]
```

<Callout type="info">
    The same message and private key might produce a different signature every time you call this
    function. Some runtimes produce randomized signatures as per
    [draft-irtf-cfrg-det-sigs-with-noise](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-irtf-cfrg-det-sigs-with-noise/)
    while others produce deterministic signatures as per [RFC
    8032](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8032).
</Callout>

### Signing transactions

In Kit, private keys are used to digitally sign transactions on behalf of account owners, to approve spending, transfers, and modifications to account data on the blockchain.

```ts twoslash
import { Transaction } from '@solana/kit';
const transaction = null as unknown as Transaction;
const bobsKeyPair = null as unknown as CryptoKeyPair;
// ---cut-before---
import { signTransaction } from '@solana/kit';
const signedTransaction = await signTransaction([bobsKeyPair], transaction);
```

In practice, it's rare to sign transactions like this. Typically, you create a transaction message in your application, specify which accounts are required to sign it using the [Signers API](/concepts/signers), and then call [`signTransactionMessageWithSigners`](/api/functions/signTransactionMessageWithSigners) to turn it into a signed `Transaction`.

## Using public keys

A public key is a `CryptoKey` whose `type` property is set to `'public'` and whose `usages` property includes `'verify'`.

Solana uses public keys to verify that modifications to account data and balances through transactions are approved of by those who hold the private keys required to authorize such modifications. Kit generally only uses public keys to derive the address of their associated accounts, but it can also use public keys to enable your programs to verify arbitrary messages.

### Verifying signatures

The public key associated with a given private key can be used by anyone to verify that a message was signed by the holder of the associated private key, as described above. The verification function requires the original message, a digital signature, and the public key associated with the owner who is believed to have produced that signature. Successful verification implies that the contents of the message signed by the owner are identical to the contents of the message that was given to the verification function. Key owners are free to share their public key with anyone they would like to grant the ability to verify their digital signatures.

If someone sends us a message and signature that they claim to be from the example above, we could use Bob's public key to verify that the signature was in fact the one produced by Bob and that the message was not modified in transit.

```ts twoslash
import { SignatureBytes } from '@solana/kit';
const bobsPublicKey = null as unknown as CryptoKey;
const supposedlyBobsSignature = null as unknown as SignatureBytes;
// ---cut-before---
import { getUtf8Encoder, verifySignature } from '@solana/kit';
const verificationSucceeded = await verifySignature(
    bobsPublicKey,
    supposedlyBobsSignature,
    getUtf8Encoder().encode('The meeting is at 6:00pm'),
);
if (!verificationSucceeded) {
    throw new Error(
        'Either the message was modified, the signature was not produced by Bob, or both',
    );
}
```

Verification protects equally against false claims of who produced the signature as it does against false claims about what message was signed. Both of these will return `false`;

{/* prettier-ignore */}
```ts twoslash
import { SignatureBytes } from '@solana/kit';
const bobsPublicKey = null as unknown as CryptoKey;
const bobsSignature = null as unknown as SignatureBytes;
const mallorysSignature = null as unknown as SignatureBytes;
const signature = null as unknown as SignatureBytes;
// ---cut-before---
import { getUtf8Encoder, verifySignature } from '@solana/kit';
// False claim that Bob signed the message when it was in fact Mallory
await verifySignature(
    bobsPublicKey,
    mallorysSignature,
  //^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
    getUtf8Encoder().encode('The meeting is at 6:00pm'),
);
// False claim about the contents of the message
await verifySignature(
    bobsPublicKey,
    bobsSignature,
    getUtf8Encoder().encode('The meeting is at 6:00am'),
    //                                         ^^^^^^
);
```

### Deriving addresses

The Solana address associated with any public key can be derived using the [`getAddressFromPublicKey()`](/api/functions/getAddressFromPublicKey) function.

```ts twoslash
const keyPair = null as unknown as CryptoKeyPair;
// ---cut-before---
import { getAddressFromPublicKey } from '@solana/kit';
const address = await getAddressFromPublicKey(keyPair.publicKey);
```

## Signatures

The [`SignatureBytes`](/api/type-aliases/SignatureBytes) type represents a 64-byte Ed25519 signature, and the [`Signature`](/api/type-aliases/Signature) type represents such a signature as a base58-encoded string.

When you acquire a string that you expect to be a base58-encoded signature (eg. of a transaction) from an untrusted network API or user input you can assert it is in fact a base58-encoded byte array of sufficient length using the [`assertIsSignature()`](/api/functions/assertIsSignature) function.

```ts twoslash
// @noErrors: 1308
import { GetSignatureStatusesApi, Rpc } from '@solana/kit';
const rpc = null as unknown as Rpc<GetSignatureStatusesApi>;
const signatureInput = null as unknown as HTMLInputElement;
// ---cut-before---
import { assertIsSignature } from '@solana/kit';

// Imagine a function that asserts whether a user-supplied signature is valid or not.
function handleSubmit() {
    // We know only that what the user typed conforms to the `string` type.
    const signature: string = signatureInput.value;
    try {
        // If this type assertion function doesn't throw, then
        // Typescript will upcast `signature` to `Signature`.
        assertIsSignature(signature);
        // At this point, `signature` is a `Signature` that can be used with the RPC.
        const {
            value: [status],
        } = await rpc.getSignatureStatuses([signature]).send();
    } catch (e) {
        // `signature` turned out not to be a base58-encoded signature
    }
}
```

Similarly, you can use the [`isSignature()`](/api/functions/isSignature) type guard. It will return `true` if the input string conforms to the `Signature` type and will refine the type for use in your program from that point onward. This method does not throw in the opposite case.

```ts twoslash
import { GetSignatureStatusesApi, Rpc } from '@solana/kit';
const rpc = null as unknown as Rpc<GetSignatureStatusesApi>;
const signature = '';
function setError(s: string) {}
function setSignatureStatus(
    s: ReturnType<GetSignatureStatusesApi['getSignatureStatuses']>['value'][number],
) {}
// ---cut-before---
import { isSignature } from '@solana/kit';

if (isSignature(signature)) {
    // At this point, `signature` has been refined to a
    // `Signature` that can be used with the RPC.
    const {
        value: [status],
    } = await rpc.getSignatureStatuses([signature]).send();
    setSignatureStatus(status);
} else {
    setError(`${signature} is not a transaction signature`);
}
```

The [`signature()`](/api/functions/signature) helper combines _asserting_ that a string is an Ed25519 signature with _coercing_ it to the `Signature` type. It's best used with untrusted input.

```ts
import { signature } from '@solana/keys';

const signature = signature(userSuppliedSignature);
const {
    value: [status],
} = await rpc.getSignatureStatuses([signature]).send();
```

## Runtime Support

All major JavaScript runtimes support the Ed25519 digital signature algorithm required by Solana.

### Ed25519 Polyfill [#polyfill]

To use keys in a runtime without Ed25519 digital signature algorithm support, install the following polyfill.

```package-install
@solana/webcrypto-ed25519-polyfill
```

Then import and install it before invoking any operations that create or make use of `CryptoKey` objects.

```ts twoslash
import { install } from '@solana/webcrypto-ed25519-polyfill';

// Calling this will shim methods on `SubtleCrypto`, adding Ed25519 support.
install();

// Now you can do this, in environments that do not otherwise support Ed25519.
const keyPair = await crypto.subtle.generateKey({ name: 'Ed25519' }, false, ['sign']);
```

Wherever you call `install()`, make sure the call is made only once, and before any key operation requiring Ed25519 support is performed.

<Callout title="Security warning" type="warn">
    Because the polyfill's implementation of Ed25519 key generation exists in userspace, it can't
    guarantee that the keys you generate with it are non-exportable. Untrusted code running in your
    JavaScript context may still be able to gain access to and/or exfiltrate secret key material.
</Callout>

<Callout title="Storing polyfilled keys in IndexedDB" type="warn">
    Native `CryptoKeys` can be stored in IndexedDB, but the keys created by this polyfill can not.
