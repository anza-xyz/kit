description: Sign and verify messages and transactions using Ed25519 keys

## Introduction

Kit uses the primitives built-in to JavaScriptâ€™s Web Crypto API to perform cryptography. This keeps your applications small, and confers to them the security and performance characteristics of the runtime's native cryptography functions.

Ed25519 keys created or imported using the native APIs are compatible with all of Kit's cryptographic features. Kit also offers several helpers to generate, import, and transform key material.

<Callout title="Looking for Signers instead?">
  Keys are a low-level primitive. While it's important to know how they work, in a Solana application it's often more
  appropriate to deal with key material in terms of the accounts and wallets that sign a transaction or message. The
  [Signers](/concepts/signers) API offers an ergonomic way to build and sign transactions using accounts and their
  associated keys.

## Installation

Key management functions are **included within the `@solana/kit` library** but you may also install them using their standalone package.

```package-install
@solana/keys
```

<Callout title="Not all runtimes support the cryptography required by Solana" type="warn">
  When deploying your application to a JavaScript runtime that lacks support for the Ed25519 digital signature
  algorithm, [import our polyfill](#polyfill) before invoking any operations that create or make use of `CryptoKey`
  objects.

## Runtime Support

All major JavaScript runtimes support the Ed25519 digital signature algorithm required by Solana.

### Ed25519 Polyfill [#polyfill]

To use keys in a runtime without Ed25519 digital signature algorithm support, install the following polyfill.

```package-install
@solana/webcrypto-ed25519-polyfill
```

Then import and install it before invoking any operations that create or make use of `CryptoKey` objects.

```ts twoslash
import { install } from "@solana/webcrypto-ed25519-polyfill";

// Calling this will shim methods on `SubtleCrypto`, adding Ed25519 support.
install();

// Now you can do this, in environments that do not otherwise support Ed25519.
const keyPair = await crypto.subtle.generateKey({ name: "Ed25519" }, false, ["sign"]);
```

Wherever you call `install()`, make sure the call is made only once, and before any key operation requiring Ed25519 support is performed.

<Callout title="Security warning" type="warn">
  Because the polyfill's implementation of Ed25519 key generation exists in userspace, it can't guarantee that the keys
  you generate with it are non-exportable. Untrusted code running in your JavaScript context may still be able to gain
  access to and/or exfiltrate secret key material.
</Callout>

<Callout title="Storing polyfilled keys in IndexedDB" type="warn">
  Native `CryptoKeys` can be stored in IndexedDB, but the keys created by this polyfill can not. This is because, unlike
  native `CryptoKeys`, our polyfilled key objects can not implement the [structured clone
  algorithm](https://www.w3.org/TR/WebCryptoAPI/#cryptokey-interface-clone).
