title: Signers
description: Accounts with signing capabilities
---

## Introduction

Signers are an abstraction that combines an account with an implementation that computes signatures on behalf of that account. No matter what actually computes the signature – a wallet app, a network API, the `SubtleCrypto` API, or a userspace implementation – so long as it implements the correct signer interface for your intended purpose, you can use it with all of Kit's signer-aware functions.

Signers are designed to make it easier to build, sign, and send transactions by taking the guesswork out of which accounts' key pairs need to sign a transaction. Signer-aware APIs allow you to associate signer objects with each transaction instruction that requires them, enabling Kit's transaction planning, signing, and sending functions to automatically collect and invoke them.

## Installation

Signers are **included within the `@solana/kit` library** but you may also install them using their standalone package.

```package-install
@solana/signers
```

## What is a signer?

All signers are wrappers around an [`Address`](/api/type-aliases/Address). This means that most APIs that require an `Address` can be made to accept a signer. Each specific type of signer adds one or more capabilities, such as the ability to sign a message or a transaction on behalf of the account with that address. Some even add the ability to sign _and_ send a transaction, which is common for wallets that you use in your browser or on your phone.

```ts twoslash
// @noErrors: 2769
import {
    createSignableMessage,
    createTransactionMessage,
    generateKeyPairSigner,
    pipe,
    setTransactionMessageFeePayerSigner,
    signTransactionMessageWithSigners,
} from '@solana/kit';

// Generate a key pair signer.
const mySigner = await generateKeyPairSigner();
mySigner.address; // The address of the account

// Sign one or multiple messages.
const myMessage = createSignableMessage('Hello world!');
const [messageSignatures] = await mySigner.signMessages([myMessage]);
//                                ^^^^^^^^

// Sign to pay fees for a transaction message
const myTransactionMessage = pipe(
    createTransactionMessage({ version: 0 }),
    (m) => setTransactionMessageFeePayerSigner(mySigner, m),
    //                                         ^^^^^^^^
    // Add instructions, lifetime, etc.
);
const signedTransaction = await signTransactionMessageWithSigners(myTransactionMessage);
```

As you can see, this provides a consistent API regardless of how things are being signed behind the scenes. If tomorrow we need to use a browser wallet instead, we'd simply need to swap the `generateKeyPairSigner()` function with the signer factory of our choice.

## Types of signers

This package offers a total of five different types of signers that may be used in combination when applicable. Three of them allow us to sign transactions whereas the other two are used for regular message signing.

They are separated into three categories:

- **Partial signers**: Given a message or transaction, provide one or more signatures for it. These signers are not able to modify the given data which allows us to run many of them in parallel.
- **Modifying signers**: Can choose to modify a message or transaction before signing it with zero or more private keys. Because modifying a message or transaction invalidates any pre-existing signatures over it, modifying signers must do their work before any other signer.
- **Sending signers**: Given a transaction, signs it and sends it immediately to the blockchain. When applicable, the signer may also decide to modify the provided transaction before signing it. This interface accommodates wallets that simply cannot sign a transaction without sending it at the same time. This category of signers does not apply to regular messages.

Thus, we end up with the following interfaces.

|                                                            | Partial signers                                                          | Modifying signers                                                            | Sending signers                                                          |
| ---------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| [`TransactionSigner`](/api/type-aliases/TransactionSigner) | [`TransactionPartialSigner`](/api/type-aliases/TransactionPartialSigner) | [`TransactionModifyingSigner`](/api/type-aliases/TransactionModifyingSigner) | [`TransactionSendingSigner`](/api/type-aliases/TransactionSendingSigner) |
| [`MessageSigner`](/api/type-aliases/MessageSigner)         | [`MessagePartialSigner`](/api/type-aliases/MessagePartialSigner)         | [`MessageModifyingSigner`](/api/type-aliases/MessageModifyingSigner)         | N/A                                                                      |

We will go through each of these five signer interfaces and their respective characteristics in the documentation below.

## Signing transactions

### Partial signers [#transaction-partial-signers]

[`TransactionPartialSigner`](/api/type-aliases/TransactionPartialSigner) is an interface that signs an array of [`Transactions`](/api/type-aliases/Transaction) without modifying their content. It defines a `signTransactions` function that returns a [`SignatureDictionary`](/api/type-aliases/SignatureDictionary) for each provided transaction. Such signature dictionaries are expected to be merged with the existing ones if any.

```ts twoslash
// @noErrors: 2355
import { address, SignatureDictionary, Transaction, TransactionPartialSigner } from '@solana/kit';
// ---cut-before---
const myTransactionPartialSigner: TransactionPartialSigner<'1234..5678'> = {
    address: address('1234..5678'),
    signTransactions: async (transactions: Transaction[]): Promise<SignatureDictionary[]> => {
        // My custom signing logic.
    },
};
```

**Characteristics**:

- **Parallel**. It returns a signature dictionary for each provided transaction without modifying them, making it possible for multiple partial signers to sign the same transaction in parallel.
- **Flexible order**. The order in which we use these signers for a given transaction doesn’t matter.

### Modifying signers

[`TransactionModifyingSigner`](/api/type-aliases/TransactionModifyingSigner) is an interface that potentially modifies the provided [`Transactions`](/api/type-aliases/Transaction) before signing them. E.g. this enables wallets to inject additional instructions into the transaction before signing them. For each transaction, instead of returning a [`SignatureDictionary`](/api/type-aliases/SignatureDictionary), its `modifyAndSignTransactions` function returns an updated [`Transaction`](/api/type-aliases/Transaction) with a potentially modified set of instructions and signature dictionary.

```ts twoslash
// @noErrors: 2355
import { address, Transaction, TransactionModifyingSigner } from '@solana/kit';
// ---cut-before---
const myTransactionModifyingSigner: TransactionModifyingSigner<'1234..5678'> = {
    address: address('1234..5678'),
    modifyAndSignTransactions: async <T extends Transaction>(transactions: T[]): Promise<T[]> => {
        // My custom signing logic.
    },
};
```

**Characteristics**:

- **Sequential**. Contrary to partial signers, these cannot be executed in parallel as each call can modify the provided transactions.
- **First signers**. For a given transaction, a modifying signer must always be used before a partial signer as the former will likely modify the transaction and thus impact the outcome of the latter.
- **Potential conflicts**. If more than one modifying signer is provided, the second signer may invalidate the signature of the first one. However, modifying signers may decide not to modify a transaction based on the existence of signatures for that transaction.

### Sending signers

[`TransactionSendingSigner`](/api/type-aliases/TransactionSendingSigner) is an interface that signs one or multiple transactions before sending them immediately to the blockchain. It defines a `signAndSendTransactions` function that returns the transaction signature (i.e. its identifier) for each provided [`Transaction`](/api/type-aliases/Transaction). This interface is required for PDA wallets and other types of wallets that don't provide an interface for signing transactions without sending them.

Note that it is also possible for such signers to modify the provided transactions before signing and sending them. This enables use cases where the modified transactions cannot be shared with the app and thus must be sent directly.

```ts twoslash
// @noErrors: 2355
import { address, SignatureBytes, Transaction, TransactionSendingSigner } from '@solana/kit';
// ---cut-before---
const myTransactionSendingSigner: TransactionSendingSigner<'1234..5678'> = {
    address: address('1234..5678'),
    signAndSendTransactions: async (transactions: Transaction[]): Promise<SignatureBytes[]> => {
        // My custom signing logic.
    },
};
```

**Characteristics**:

- **Single signer**. Since this signer also sends the provided transactions, we can only use a single [`TransactionSendingSigner`](/api/type-aliases/TransactionSendingSigner) for a given set of transactions.
- **Last signer**. Trivially, that signer must also be the last one used.
- **Potential conflicts**. Since signers may decide to modify the given transactions before sending them, they may invalidate previous signatures. However, signers may decide not to modify a transaction based on the existence of signatures for that transaction.
- **Potential confirmation**. Whilst this is not required by this interface, it is also worth noting that most wallets will also wait for the transaction to be confirmed (typically with a `confirmed` commitment) before notifying the app that they are done.

## Signing messages

### Signable messages

[`SignableMessage`](/api/type-aliases/SignableMessage) defines a message with any of the signatures that might have already been provided by other signers. This interface allows modifying signers to decide on whether or not they should modify the provided message depending on whether or not signatures already exist for such message. It also helps create a more consistent API by providing a structure analogous to transactions which also keep track of their signature dictionary.

```ts twoslash
import { SignatureDictionary } from '@solana/kit';
// ---cut-before---
type SignableMessage = {
    content: Uint8Array;
    signatures: SignatureDictionary; // Record<Address, SignatureBytes>
};
```

You can use the [`createSignableMessage`](/api/functions/createSignableMessage) function to create a [`SignableMessage`](/api/type-aliases/SignableMessage) from a `Uint8Array` or UTF-8 string. It optionally accepts a signature dictionary if the message already contains signatures.

```ts twoslash
import { address, createSignableMessage, SignatureBytes } from '@solana/kit';
// ---cut-before--
const myMessage = createSignableMessage(new Uint8Array([1, 2, 3]));
const myMessageFromText = createSignableMessage('Hello world!');
const myMessageWithSignatures = createSignableMessage('Hello world!', {
    [address('1234..5678')]: new Uint8Array([1, 2, 3]) as SignatureBytes,
});
```

### Partial signers

[`MessagePartialSigner`](/api/type-aliases/MessagePartialSigner) is an interface that signs an array of [`SignableMessages`](/api/type-aliases/SignableMessage) without modifying their content. It defines a `signMessages` function that returns a [`SignatureDictionary`](/api/type-aliases/SignatureDictionary) for each provided message. Such signature dictionaries are expected to be merged with the existing ones if any.

```ts twoslash
// @noErrors: 2355
import { address, MessagePartialSigner, SignableMessage, SignatureDictionary } from '@solana/kit';
// ---cut-before---
const myMessagePartialSigner: MessagePartialSigner<'1234..5678'> = {
    address: address('1234..5678'),
    signMessages: async (messages: SignableMessage[]): Promise<SignatureDictionary[]> => {
        // My custom signing logic.
    },
};
```

**Characteristics**:

- **Parallel**. When multiple signers sign the same message, we can perform this operation in parallel to obtain all their signatures.
- **Flexible order**. The order in which we use these signers for a given message doesn’t matter.

### Modifying signers

[`MessageModifyingSigner`](/api/type-aliases/MessageModifyingSigner) is an interface that potentially modifies the content of the provided [`SignableMessages`](/api/type-aliases/SignableMessage) before signing them. E.g. this enables wallets to prefix or suffix nonces to the messages they sign. For each message, instead of returning a [`SignatureDictionary`](/api/type-aliases/SignatureDictionary), its `modifyAndSignMessages` function returns its updated [`SignableMessage`](/api/type-aliases/SignableMessage) with a potentially modified content and signature dictionary.

```ts twoslash
// @noErrors: 2355
import { address, MessageModifyingSigner, SignableMessage } from '@solana/kit';
// ---cut-before---
const myMessageModifyingSigner: MessageModifyingSigner<'1234..5678'> = {
    address: address('1234..5678'),
    modifyAndSignMessages: async (messages: SignableMessage[]): Promise<SignableMessage[]> => {
        // My custom signing logic.
    },
};
```

**Characteristics**:

- **Sequential**. Contrary to partial signers, these cannot be executed in parallel as each call can modify the content of the message.
- **First signers**. For a given message, a modifying signer must always be used before a partial signer as the former will likely modify the message and thus impact the outcome of the latter.
- **Potential conflicts**. If more than one modifying signer is provided, the second signer may invalidate the signature of the first one. However, modifying signers may decide not to modify a message based on the existence of signatures for that message.

## Available signers

### No-op signers

For a given address, a <abbr title="no-operation">no-op</abbr> signer can be created to offer an implementation of both the `MessagePartialSigner` and `TransactionPartialSigner` interfaces such that they do not sign anything. Namely, signing a transaction or a message with a `NoopSigner` will return an empty `SignatureDictionary`.

This signer may be useful:

- For testing purposes.
- For indicating that a given account is a signer and taking the responsibility to provide the signature for that account ourselves. For instance, if we need to send the transaction to a server that will sign it and send it for us.

```ts twoslash
import { address, SignableMessage, Transaction } from '@solana/kit';
const myMessage = null as unknown as SignableMessage;
const myTransaction = null as unknown as Transaction;
// ---cut-before---
import { createNoopSigner } from '@solana/kit';

const myNoopSigner = createNoopSigner(address('1234..5678'));
const [myMessageSignatures] = await myNoopSigner.signMessages([myMessage]); // <- Empty signature dictionary.
const [myTransactionSignatures] = await myNoopSigner.signTransactions([myTransaction]); // <- Empty signature dictionary.
```

### Key pair signers

A key pair signer uses a `CryptoKeyPair` to sign messages and transactions. It implements both the `MessagePartialSigner` and `TransactionPartialSigner` interfaces and keeps track of the `CryptoKeyPair` instance used to sign messages and transactions.

[createSignerFromKeyPair](#create-signer-from-key-pair)
[generateKeyPairSigner](#generate-key-pair-signer)

[createKeyPairSignerFromPrivateKeyBytes](#create-key-pair-signer-from-private-key-bytes)

</div>

#### createSignerFromKeyPair [!toc] [#create-signer-from-key-pair]

Creates a `KeyPairSigner` from a provided Crypto KeyPair. The `signMessages` and `signTransactions` functions of the returned signer will use the private key of the provided key pair to sign messages and transactions. Note that both the `signMessages` and `signTransactions` implementations are parallelized, meaning that they will sign all provided messages and transactions in parallel.

```ts twoslash
import { createSignerFromKeyPair, generateKeyPair, KeyPairSigner } from '@solana/kit';

const myKeyPair: CryptoKeyPair = await generateKeyPair();
const myKeyPairSigner: KeyPairSigner = await createSignerFromKeyPair(myKeyPair);
```

#### generateKeyPairSigner [!toc] [#generate-key-pair-signer]

A convenience function that generates a new Crypto KeyPair and immediately creates a `KeyPairSigner` from it.

```ts twoslash
import { generateKeyPairSigner } from '@solana/kit';

const myKeyPairSigner = await generateKeyPairSigner();
```

#### createKeyPairSignerFromBytes [!toc] [#create-key-pair-signer-from-bytes]

A convenience function that creates a new KeyPair from a 64-bytes `Uint8Array` secret key and immediately creates a `KeyPairSigner` from it.

```ts twoslash
import fs from 'fs';
import { createKeyPairSignerFromBytes } from '@solana/kit';

// Get bytes from local keypair file.
const keypairFile = fs.readFileSync('~/.config/solana/id.json');
const keypairBytes = new Uint8Array(JSON.parse(keypairFile.toString()));

// Create a KeyPairSigner from the bytes.
const signer = await createKeyPairSignerFromBytes(keypairBytes);
```

#### createKeyPairSignerFromPrivateKeyBytes [!toc] [#create-key-pair-signer-from-private-key-bytes]

A convenience function that creates a new KeyPair from a 32-bytes `Uint8Array` private key and immediately creates a `KeyPairSigner` from it.

```ts twoslash
import { createKeyPairSignerFromPrivateKeyBytes, getUtf8Encoder } from '@solana/kit';

const message = getUtf8Encoder().encode('Hello, World!');
const seed = new Uint8Array(await crypto.subtle.digest('SHA-256', message));

const derivedSigner = await createKeyPairSignerFromPrivateKeyBytes(seed);
```
